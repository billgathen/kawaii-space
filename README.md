# Kawaii Space (still in development)
## by Bill Gathen @billgathen on GitHub

This is a work in progress! Please be gentle with me: it's my first game.

Use any basic HTTP server to serve index.html: I use Live Server (Ritwick Dey) in VSCode.

a and d keys rotate the left ship: it constantly moves forward until it hits something.

j and l keys rotate the right ship: it also moves constantly.

When they collide, they "blow up".
